            <h2>History of Tisanes as Herbal Remedies</h2>
            <p>
              Herbal teas have a long history all over the world. Herbal tea is
              simply an infusion of any edible plant. It is available in huge
              varieties and can be made using many different ingredients,
              including tree bark, flowers, leaves, roots, spices, seeds, and
              fruit. Some argue that herbal tea is not technically a ‚Äútea‚Äù
              because it does not come from the Camellia Sinensis, the tea
              plant. Traditional Chinese Medicine is famous for using herbal
              teas to heal countless ailments and afflictions. Herbal tea also
              has a medicinal history in Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Greece. Many
              cultures make herbal tea for spiritual benefit and believe it
              opens up the heart and mind to a spiritual connection.
              <br />
              <br />

              For the majority of human history, herbal teas have been the
              beverage of choice. The earliest verbal record of herbal teas
              dates back to 2737 BC in China. In written history, we can find
              records of herbal tea that go as far back as the third century AD.
              These teas spread from China to Egypt to Japan, and then to Europe
              and beyond. You may hear herbal tea called a ‚Äútisane‚Äù in Europe.

                <p class="tea-info">
                  A cup of chamomile tea can help to reduce stress and alleviate
                  anxiety. Chamomile is well-known for its relaxing properties,
                  and makes a soothing, aromatic cup of tea that‚Äôs perfect for
                  any time of day. Since chamomile is also a very mild sedative,
                  it can help you to calm down both physically and mentally.

                <p class="tea-info">
                  Drinking lavender tea before bed can help you achieve more
                  restful sleep. According to multiple scientific studies,
                  lavender tea helps calm brain function by triggering chemical
                  reactions in the nervous system. Lavender tea boosts the
                  production of dopamine and reduces the stress hormone known as
                  cortisol. One such study found that lavender increases the
                  percentage of deep slow-wave sleep, which is considered the
                  restorative sleep phase.

                  Lemongrass improves blood circulation which ultimately clears
                  up your skin by treating oily textures. It‚Äôs also great for
                  reducing anxiety and stress, as well as promoting sleep. The
                  lemongrass aroma can also be used to freshen the air and
                  uplift your mood.
